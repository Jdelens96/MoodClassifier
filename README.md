# MoodClassifier
Working on building a Deep Learning model which eprforms image classification to predict the mood of a the image. I have used images found on a google search for 'happy' and 'sad' using Python, Tensorflow and Keras using virtual datasets. This project is still ongoing as I am taking the time to reseach documentation behind dependencies and have now sorted the data to start building the model.
